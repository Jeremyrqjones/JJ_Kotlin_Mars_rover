# JJ_Kotlin_Mars_rover
An Android project using Jetpack and Kotlin

<p>The goal of this project is to explore Android's Jetpack suite of libraries and create a beautiful app to publish in the Play Store. The app uses NASA's public API's to get images from several Mars rovers and displays images captured from each of them. 
The app is simple right now, currently only calling one API endpoint and displaying the images one at a time with a single button to view the next image.</p>

Road Map
<ul>
<li>Two up, scrollable grid view
<li>Use ViewPager so a user can swipe the images
<li>Searchable by Rover, Camera, Earth date and Sol
</ul>

Currently this project is using
<ul>
<li>ViewModel</li>
<li>LiveData</li>
<li>Retrofit 2</li>
<li>kotlin coroutines</li>
<li>Picasso</li>
</ul>
